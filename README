This project is a demonstration of how the DNS system works. Carry out the following steps to make it working.
Since the demonstration works on an apache server and interacts with mysql database, make sure you have both of these installed with php5 and there is interaction between the three.



STEP - 1 Make your DNS server capable of handling queries whose data is not contained in its local database.
Put the bash scripts "resolver" and "iterative" into your bin folder. This carries out the DNS queries related to domain names that are not found in the local database.

make it an executable

sudo chmod +x resolver
sudo chmod +x iterative



STEP - 2 Setting up your local domain matching table.
Create a table named dns in the test database with the following fields:
name varchar(256)
type varchar(10)
result varchar(256)
uses int

create table dns(name varchar(256), type varchar(10), result varchar(256), uses int);
grant all privileges on *.* to root@localhost identified by '';




STEP - 3 Providing permissions to apache server
Let the apache user "www-data" own the www directory in which the source code is.

sudo chown www-data /var/www/networks/src



STEP - 4
Load the page "query.php". Type in your query and press the appropriate button for the appropriate query.
